## Description

A simple Matlab script that provides key information about a transfer function. It covers important aspects such as poles, zeros, step response, bode plot, nyquist plot, etc.

## Usage

To use the code and explore the transfer function analysis, follow these steps:

1. Download the `matlab_RST` or `matlab_RST_livescript` file.
2. Open the file with MATLAB or Octave. (Note: The livescript can only be used with MATLAB.)
3. The script already includes an example transfer function for demonstration purposes.
4. If you want to analyze your specific transfer function, replace the example transfer function with your desired one.
5. 4. Run the script to observe the output and gain insights into the transfer function.
7. Feel free to explore and modify the code according to your requirements.

The `matlab_RST_livescript` is particularly useful for quick observations and insights. It provides a more interactive and dynamic environment compared to the regular script.
